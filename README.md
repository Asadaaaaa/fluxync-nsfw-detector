# **PROJECT IDEA**

Aim of this project is to develop an image classification of NSFW Images based on CNN using MobileNetV2 from Keras model.

The model shows a decent performance in predicting images, with 78.2% of test accuracy.

Further development may requires an addition of epochs on training, adding more Convolutional layer on base model, feed more data to minimalize biases.
